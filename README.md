Hookfinder for Xposed development
=================================

This module is to find renamed *methods* and *fields* in decompiled apks.

1. decompile the apk with apktool
2. define a hookfinder.settings.js based on the example
3. run the hookfinder to see which methods match the supplied signatures


You can also limit the matches by looking for specific things in the method implementations.
